		<h1>The Battlefield</h1>
		<p>
			The battlefield is the term used to describe the area in which creatures and lands are 
			played in the game of magic and it represents the arena in which the combat takes place.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below is an example of a battlefields from a competitive magic competition. The format 
			they are playing is called modern, however it runs on the same base core rules as commander
			and will function as an example.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cards on the field are selectable and can be clicked to see the gatherer page for the card.
			This displays the official wording on the ability along with any rulings made on the card and any 
			other printings of the card.
