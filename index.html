                Hi, I am Sebastian Van Den Dungen, a 4th year software engineering student at the ANU and this is my website about my commander decks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commander is a format of playing the trading card game <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> for 
                two or more players. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In magic there are many different ways to play with the same sets of cards, the official ways are referred to as “Formats”. Commander is 
                a format developed from the community and is one of the less competitive formats allowing for a variety of styles of play.
            </p>

            <p>
                Commander is my favourite format as it allows me to be very creative about what decks I want to build and play as there are many different '
                viable and fun archetypes to build. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Commander is one of what are known as singleton formats, meaning that apart from basic land cards, each card within the deck must be unique. 
                This greatly reduces the cost of entry to the format as new players do not need to purchase multiple copies of important cards in order to be 
                competitive. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally the format gets its name from a rule unique to the format, the commander card. This card, sometimes called the general, is usually 
                a creature spell which is legendary (meaning a named character from the lore). This commander card is usually selected by the player building 
                the deck to either synergise with the overall strategy of the deck, provide the requisite colours, or provide an interesting ability to the deck.

            </p>
            <p>
                My decks tend to follow the first selection criteria with the commander of the deck being a vital component of the deck’s functionality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal with this site is to chronicle my current design strategy and compositions for my existing decks as well as the new decks that I build. 
                I hope that this in the future will enable me to reflect upon my decisions and choices in order to build better decks in the future. Additionally 
                this website will allow me to express my ideas as they currently stand and gather feedback from visitors that I will integrate into my understanding 
                of the format and the commanders I chose to play with.
            </p>
